# Project-1
A simple text-based battle simulator built in lua using codea on ipad.
This is my first project as i learn lua.

Features:-
-Player and enemy health system
-Randomized attack damage
-Critical hit logic
-Win/loss conditions
-Clean loop based combat simulation
-Random chance of health/posin potions

Built In:-
-Lua (in Codea for IPAD)

Purpose:-
This is part of my coding journey as i learn Lua and prepare for more advanced IOT work. It may not look like that this project will contribute anything in my journey of IOT, but it will help me undersatnd lua deeply and increase my developer skills as i am new to coding.

What I Learned:-
-Variables, loops, and if-else logic
-Functions and tables
-How to simulate a basic game loop
-How to use Github and commit code

Project Status:-
-This is a standalone project
-I will soon (probably) add visuals to it and make a full simple and small 2d battle game.
